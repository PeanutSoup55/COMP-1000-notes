Why Study Propositional Logic In Computer Science?
Mathematical Logic can be used to precisely describe and analyze
ideas
Propositional Logic is an important subarea of this discipline and
plays a fundamental role in many areas of Computer Science such as
Logic Circuits
Database query languages
Programming languages (e.g., Prolog)
Design validation and verification, proof of correctness and termination
AI (e.g., automated reasoning systems)

Our Goals
Help you understand and construct formal proofs, appreciate formal
descriptions (particularly in theoretical computer science)
Provide sufficient background to understand and appreciate higher
order logics (predicate calculus, for example)
Analyze logical expressions in terms of satisfiabilty, validity, and
logical consequences
In the least, enable you to identify flaws in arguments

Propositions
Definition
A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false
Building block of logic
Examples of propositions (which one is true and which one is false?)
The Moon is made of green cheese
Toronto is the capital of Canada
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 0 = 2
Examples that are not propositions
Sit down!
What time is it?
x + 1 = 2
x + y = z

Compound Propositions
Constructing Propositions
How to make new propositions using existing ones
Propositional Variables: p, q, r , s, . . .
Similar to letters that denote numerical variables (for example, x = 2)
The proposition that is always true is denoted by T
The proposition that is always false is denoted by F

Truth Tables
Definition
A truth table is a breakdown of a proposition by listing all possible values
it can attain
Here is the truth table for a propositional variable p
p
T
F
Why is it the right truth table for p ?
– Because p is either true (T) or false (F)!

Compound Propositions
Definition
Compound Propositions are constructed from logical connectives and
other propositions
Negation ¬
Conjunction ∧
Disjunction ∨
Implication →
Biconditional ↔
Let’s look at each one of them in detail

Compound Propositions
Negation
The negation of a proposition p is denoted by ¬p and has this truth
table:
p ¬p
T F
F T
Example:
If p denotes “The earth is round”
Then ¬p denotes “It is not the case that the earth is round” or more
simply “The earth is not round”
For ¬p to be true, p must be false

Compound Propositions
Conjunction
The conjunction (∧) of propositions p and q is denoted by p ∧ q and
has this truth table:
p q p ∧ q
T F F
F T F
F F F
T T T
Example:
If p denotes “You are at home” and q denotes “It is raining”
Then p ∧ q denotes “You are at home” and “It is raining”
This is true if you are at home and it is raining
For p ∧ q to be true, both of p and q must be true
